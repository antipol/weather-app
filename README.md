Weather API
Create a weather app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript!
//
-> The user should be able to type in a city name and receive information about the weather of that city for the next few days.
-> Create a token in OpenWeather in order to get access to the API.

Project Architecture
//
The project will use modules for functionality that will be imported to your main js file.
Structure the project as following:
In the main js file, you should store the functionality of what the user is searching for in the weather app's input field. You should create a function to fetch the api's data and get the weather for the week.
In another file, create a function which gets the hour, minute and day to display to the user.
You should have another file which displays the rest of the weather data to the user.
//
-> Bonus Create a toggle which allows users to display data in either Celcius or Fahrenheit. Create another file to store these functions.
//
Do not forget to import and export your files to the appropriate locations.
